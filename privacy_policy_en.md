## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide

**Photos and Images**

When you use our AI hairstyle generation feature, you provide photos from your camera or photo library. These photos are:

- Processed in real-time using Google's Gemini AI API
- Transmitted securely via base64 encoding to generate your styled images
- **NOT stored on our servers** — we do not retain, save, or have access to your photos
- **NOT used to improve our products** — Google's Paid Tier API does not use your data for product improvement (as per Google's API Terms)

The AI-generated hairstyle images are stored **only on your device** in the App's local gallery.

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically

**Analytics Data**

We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to improve our App. This may include:

- Device type and operating system version
- App usage patterns and feature interactions
- Crash reports and performance data
- Session duration and frequency

This data is collected in aggregate form and does not personally identify you.

**Purchase Information**

When you make in-app purchases, we use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and credits. RevenueCat may collect:

- Anonymous user identifiers
- Purchase history and subscription status
- Transaction data processed by Apple

We do not have access to your payment details (credit card numbers, billing address, etc.) as all payments are processed securely by Apple.

### 1.3 Device Permissions

The App requires access to:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Camera** | To take photos for hairstyle generation |
| **Photo Library** | To select existing photos and save generated images |

You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings.

### 1.4 Local Storage

We store limited data locally on your device:

- **Keychain**: To track free trial usage (persists across reinstalls)
